  "manual.introduction.text": "This mod is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of computer architecture. It allows you to construct a virtual computer within the Minecraft universe using specific blocks that represent different components of a computer system. These components include registers, a control unit, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and memory. \n By placing these blocks onto the same bus, you can create a fully functional computer simulation. This setup mirrors a simplified structure of a real-world computer, where different components communicate and interact through a shared bus system.\n Programming and Execution\n Once your computer is built, you can bring it to life using a program assembled in the programming block. This feature introduces the concept of assembly language and how instructions are executed in a computer system.\n You can write programs, load them into your computer, and watch as your instructions are carried out in the Minecraft world. This interactive experience provides a tangible understanding of how software and hardware interact in a computer system.\n Learning and Fun\n Whether you’re a computer science student looking for a fun way to supplement your studies, a teacher seeking an engaging educational tool, or a Minecraft enthusiast interested in computers, this mod offers a unique blend of learning and gameplay.\n We hope this mod will spark your curiosity and deepen your understanding of computer systems. Enjoy building, programming, and exploring the world of computer architecture in Minecraft!\n Please refer to the subsequent sections of this manual for detailed instructions on how to use each component and assemble your computer. Happy crafting!\n",

  "manual.controlunit.text": "The Control Unit: Heart of Your Virtual Computer\n\n Welcome to the control unit, the central hub of your MIMA/RISCV computer simulation in Minecraft. This is where you’ll set the instruction set for your computer and determine what components are needed to complete your build.\n Understanding the Control Unit\n\n The control unit is the part of the computer that controls the operation of the processor. It directs the flow of data between the CPU and other devices. In our Minecraft mod, the control unit block serves a similar function. It’s where you set the instruction set architecture (ISA) for your computer, such as MIMA or RISC-V.\n Setting the Instruction Set\n\n The instruction set is a group of commands that the CPU can understand and execute. Different types of computers use different instruction sets. In our mod, you can choose between the MIMA or RISC-V instruction sets. Once you’ve set the instruction set in the control unit, your virtual computer will be able to execute instructions in that format.\n Building a Complete Computer\n\n Once you’ve set your instruction set, the control unit will help you identify what parts are missing for a complete computer. It will guide you in placing the necessary blocks like registers, ALU, and memory onto the same bus. This interactive feature provides a tangible understanding of how different components come together to form a complete computer system.\n Learning and Exploration\n\n The control unit offers a unique opportunity to learn about the inner workings of a computer. By choosing an instruction set and building a computer to support it, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture. Whether you’re a seasoned programmer or new to the world of computing, this hands-on experience is both educational and fun.\n\n Remember, building a computer is just the beginning. Once your system is complete, you can start programming and see your instructions come to life in the Minecraft world. Enjoy the journey of exploration and discovery!\n\n Please refer to the subsequent sections of this manual for detailed instructions on how to use the control unit and other components."
